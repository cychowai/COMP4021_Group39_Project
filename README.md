The player controls Pac-Man,
who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts.
Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue,
allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.
Use arrow keys to move your pacman, and press space for accelerating with double speed.
For eating each dot and cherry, you have 50 points, and after you eat cherry,
you can eat other players for 1000 points each and ghosts for 500 points each for 12s.
The game time is 2 minutes, with the highest scores player to win,
or if all the dots are eaten, the game will end also.
